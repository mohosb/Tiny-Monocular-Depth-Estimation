# Monocular Depth Estimation Project

I created this small project for one of my MSc courses. This repo is a late upload so that it is awaylable if ever needed.

The project is about a resource constrainght, one camera setup, depth estimation. There is code to distill a small model and finetune it to a more narrow task, but can be used without distillation too. The code was tested on an M2 MacBook Air, which is very far from having a strong GPU compared to PCs and other devices, but the model can still run fast and produces good results.
